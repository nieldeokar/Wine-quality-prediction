# Wine Quality Prediction | Assignment 2

Goal: The purpose of this individual assignment is to learn how to develop parallel machine learning (ML) applications in Amazon AWS cloud platform. Specifically, you will learn: (1) how to use Apache Spark to train an ML model in parallel on multiple EC2 instances; (2) how to use Sparkâ€™s MLlib to develop and use an ML model in the cloud; (3) How to use Docker to create a container for your ML model to simplify model deployment.
